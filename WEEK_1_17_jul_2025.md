## Zero-copy

### 🔍 What is it?
Zero-copy is a technique that avoids unnecessary data copying between kernel space and user space during I/O operations, significantly improving performance by reducing CPU cycles and memory bandwidth usage.

### 💡 In simple terms
Imagine you're moving furniture from one room to another. Instead of carrying each piece yourself (traditional I/O), zero-copy is like putting wheels on the furniture and rolling it directly to its destination.

### 🌟 Did you know?
In high-performance systems like Kafka, zero-copy techniques can improve throughput by up to 1000%!

## User space vs Kernel space

### 🔍 What is it?
Operating systems divide memory into two distinct regions: kernel space (where privileged operations run) and user space (where applications run), creating a security boundary that protects critical system functions.

### 💡 In simple terms
Think of kernel space as the "employees-only" area of a restaurant (Privileged Access, Critical Functions, High Security), while user space is the dining area (restricted access, must make requests for service).

### 🌟 Did you know?
Every time your application makes a system call, it's crossing the boundary from user space to kernel space - a process known as a "context switch" that has measurable performance costs!

## ACID

### 🔍 What is it?
ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) is a set of properties that guarantee database transactions are processed reliably, ensuring data validity despite errors, power failures, etc.

### 💡 In simple terms
ACID is like the safety features of a car:
- **Atomicity**: All-or-nothing - like airbags that either fully deploy or don't deploy at all
- **Consistency**: Following the rules - like staying within lane markings
- **Isolation**: Independence - like having your own lane so other cars don't interfere
- **Durability**: Permanence - like recording your journey in a way that survives even if the car breaks down

### 🌟 Did you know?
NoSQL databases often relax some ACID properties in favor of performance and scalability, following what's known as the BASE model (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventually consistent).

## Idempotency

### 🔍 What is it?
Idempotency is a property where an operation can be applied multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application - crucial for reliable systems that may need to retry operations.

### 💡 In simple terms
It's like pressing an elevator button. Press it once, it lights up. Press it five more times, and the result is the same - the elevator is still coming to your floor.

### 🌟 Did you know?
HTTP methods GET, PUT, and DELETE are designed to be idempotent, while POST is not - which is why refreshing a page after a form submission might create duplicate entries!
Another example is Kafka idempotency, where it ensures that a message is written to a Kafka topic only once, even if the producer sends it multiple times due to network issues or retries.

## Redo log

### 🔍 What is it?
A redo log is a database mechanism that records all changes made to data, allowing the database to recover and recreate those changes in case of a crash or failure.

### 💡 In simple terms
Think of it as a detailed recipe journal. If your cake falls on the floor before serving (system crash), you can look at your journal and make the exact same cake again (recovery).

### 🌟 Did you know?
Oracle's redo logs operate in a circular fashion - once filled, they wrap around and start overwriting the oldest entries, which is why regular backups are essential!

## Write ahead log

### 🔍 What is it?
A Write Ahead Log (WAL) is a technique where changes are first recorded in a log before being applied to the database, ensuring durability and atomicity of transactions.

### 💡 In simple terms
It's like writing a check in your checkbook register before actually spending the money. If you forget what you bought, you can always check your register to see where the money went.

### 🌟 Did you know?
PostgreSQL's WAL is also used for replication, allowing standby servers to stay in sync by replaying the same sequence of changes!

## Isolation Levels

### 🔍 What is it?
Database isolation levels define how transaction integrity is visible to other users and systems, balancing data consistency with performance by controlling phenomena like dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads.

### 💡 In simple terms
Isolation levels are like privacy settings for database transactions:
- **Read Uncommitted**: No privacy - you can see everyone's unfinished work
- **Read Committed**: Basic privacy - you only see completed work
- **Repeatable Read**: Enhanced privacy - what you see won't change during your session
- **Serializable**: Complete privacy - as if everyone is working one at a time

### 🌟 Did you know?
The default isolation level varies significantly between database systems: SQL Server uses Read Committed, Oracle uses Read Committed, MySQL's InnoDB uses Repeatable Read, and PostgreSQL uses Read Committed!
